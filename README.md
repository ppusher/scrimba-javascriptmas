# 24 days of #JavaScriptmas🎄 by Scrimba.com

To help developers sharpen their Javascript skills good guys at Scrimba created an advent calender called 24 Days of JavaScriptmas🎄.

From December 1st  until Christmas Eve 🎅🏻, small coding challenges were presented every single day. To make sure everyone interested in this challenge stays motivated to not only participate but also code everyday various prizes were given to a lucky participant on successfully completion of the day's challenge. And a raffle on Christmas eve was live streamed by Per, Alex and Dylan to announce the winner for the mega prize of $1000 cash.

This repo serves as my participation proof (with my solutions) and as an archive of the 2020 #JavaScriptmas🎄 challenge.

Below are links to scrims for each day with my solution as notes to those (a scrim is a screencast with a code editor )

1. [Day 1](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co5db4025b34db715da919482) 🍬Candies - n children have got m pieces of candy. Determine how many pieces of candy will be eaten by all the children together without splitting individual candy. 
2. [Day 2](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cobcf40c294b8875ce3ab5ca3) 🏦Deposit Profit - You've deposited a specific amount of dollars into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. Find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.
3. [Day 3](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cofe74f56bbf52f00275004e8) 🧚 Chunky Monkey - Split an array (first argument) into groups with the length of size  of the second argument and return a two-dimensional array.

# 24 days of #JavaScriptmas🎄 by Scrimba.com

To help developers sharpen their Javascript skills good guys at Scrimba created an advent calender called 24 Days of JavaScriptmas🎄.

From December 1st  until Christmas Eve 🎅🏻, small coding challenges were presented every single day. To make sure everyone interested in this challenge stays motivated to not only participate but also code everyday various prizes were given to a lucky participant on successfully completion of the day's challenge. And a raffle on Christmas eve was live streamed by Per, Alex and Dylan to announce the winner for the mega prize of $1000 cash.

This repo serves as my participation proof (with my solutions) and as an archive of the 2020 #JavaScriptmas🎄 challenge.
